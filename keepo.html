    <h3><strong>UX Heuristic Evaluation</strong></h3>

      <p>The User Interface redesign was based on an evaluation taking into account Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics.</p><br>

          <p>The information section is well explained and has an agile reading pace. The contact email and privacy policy give credibility and trust. Icons are informative but the hierarchy of statements can be modified to highlight the core application tasks first. It is unclear I can do different actions as an administrator and as a resident.</p>

          <p>A white empty box greets the user after clicking on the payment history section.

    <h3><strong>Design: Concepts & Sketching</strong></h3>
    <div>
      <p>Using the double diamond methodology, key insights from the research were taken into account to suggest ten features for the app based mainly on the pleasure and pains points that bike users experience in Mexico City. Using the Value vs Complexity Quadrant methodology, four features were selected to develop a prototype.</p>
      <p>They bring high value to users since they have not been experienced altogether in other apps for cycling in the city. Also, in terms of engineering, they are a combination of low and high complexity.</p>

    <h3><strong>Develop: Prototyping</strong></h3>
    <div>
      <p>Three usability tests were conducted to the interactive Low-fidelity prototype to come up with the High-fidelity version. A user task flow was created to conduct the usability test and further improvements were made on each design iteration.</p>

    <h3><strong>Usability Tests</strong></h3>
    <p>Usability tests revealed that users were comfortable in known User Interface patterns. These patterns were provided by previous experiences of apps they had been using to find routes. On every design iteration with improvements, the participants also showed an acceptance of the features and perceived them as gain points if the app was to be launched.</p>

    <h3><strong>Design: Iteration</strong></h3>
    <div>
      <p>Extra improvements were made with two new usability studies taking into account Accessibility. A special annotated iteration was made focusing on a KPI and using the resulting data to formulate hypothesis on how to increase task success rate.</p>
      <p>Aside from the interactive prototype, the project was complemented with a Style guide and a Pattern Library, ready for engineer delivery.</p>

    <h3><strong>Solution & Impact Overview</strong></h3>
    <div>
      <p>The BCR application is centred in the logic behind route decision-making of bike users in Mexico City. Relevant user feedback was implemented throughout each step of the design process, from concept to prototype. Its four features, pleasant interface, and ease of use could make it a popular product choice in the digital market.</p>
