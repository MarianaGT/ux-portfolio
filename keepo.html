          <p>The information section is well explained and has an agile reading pace. The contact email and privacy policy give credibility and trust.

    <h3><strong>Design: Iteration</strong></h3>
    <div>
      <p>Extra improvements were made with two new usability studies taking into account Accessibility. A special annotated iteration was made focusing on a KPI and using the resulting data to formulate hypothesis on how to increase task success rate.</p>
      <p>Aside from the interactive prototype, the project was complemented with a Style guide and a Pattern Library, ready for engineer delivery.</p>

    <h3><strong>Solution & Impact Overview</strong></h3>
    <div>
      <p>The BCR application is centred in the logic behind route decision-making of bike users in Mexico City. Relevant user feedback was implemented throughout each step of the design process, from concept to prototype. Its four features, pleasant interface, and ease of use could make it a popular product choice in the digital market.</p>
