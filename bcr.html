    <h3><strong>Problem Overview</strong></h3>
    <p><strong>Bicycle City Routes</strong> is an application to create and share different cycling routes to encourage people to cycle more in their localities. Aimed at Mexico City residents who suffer from severe air pollution and traffic congestion problems. Its cycling community is growing due to its affordability, zero emissions and health benefits to an active lifestyle.</p>

    <h3><strong>Discovery: Research & Analysis</strong></h3>
    <div>
      <p>Eight participants who have different occupations, genders, cycling expertise from beginners to experts, and age gaps from 17 to 62 years old, were interviewed to get in-depth knowledge of their experience as bike users.</p>
      <p>Research shows that their logic is different from the car logic that dominates the roads. Since the market lacks an app with bike-specific logics to suggest routes, there is a niche opportunity for one whose content is mostly created by users who highlight routes based on safety, efficiency, discovery, and fitness.</p>

    <h3><strong>Design: Concepts & Sketching</strong></h3>
    <div>
      <p>Using the double diamond methodology, key insights from the research were taken into account to suggest ten features for the app based mainly on the pleasure and pains points that bike users experience in Mexico City. Using the Value vs Complexity Quadrant methodology, four features were selected to develop a prototype.</p>
      <p>They bring high value to users since they have not been experienced altogether in other apps for cycling in the city. Also, in terms of engineering, they are a combination of low and high complexity.</p>

    <h3><strong>Develop: Prototyping</strong></h3>
    <div>
      <p>Three usability tests were conducted to the interactive Low-fidelity prototype to come up with the High-fidelity version. A user task flow was created to conduct the usability test and further improvements were made on each design iteration.</p>

    <h3><strong>Usability Tests</strong></h3>
    <p>Usability tests revealed that users were comfortable in known User Interface patterns. These patterns were provided by previous experiences of apps they had been using to find routes. On every design iteration with improvements, the participants also showed an acceptance of the features and perceived them as gain points if the app was to be launched.</p>

    <h3><strong>Design: Iteration</strong></h3>
    <div>
      <p>Extra improvements were made with two new usability studies taking into account Accessibility. A special annotated iteration was made focusing on a KPI and using the resulting data to formulate hypothesis on how to increase task success rate.</p>
      <p>Aside from the interactive prototype, the project was complemented with a Style guide and a Pattern Library, ready for engineer delivery.</p>

    <h3><strong>Solution & Impact Overview</strong></h3>
    <p>The BCR application is centred in the logic behind route decision-making of bike users in Mexico City. Relevant user feedback was implemented throughout each step of the design process, from concept to prototype. Its four features, pleasant interface, and ease of use could make it a popular product choice in the digital market.</p>
