    <h3><strong>Problem Overview</strong></h3>
    <p><strong>Bicycle City Routes</strong> is an application to create and share different cycling routes to encourage people to cycle more in their localities. Aimed at Mexico City residents who suffer from severe air pollution and traffic congestion problems. Its cycling community is growing due to its affordability, zero emissions and health benefits to an active lifestyle.</p>

    <h3><strong>Discovery: Research & Analysis</strong></h3>
    <div>
      <p>Eight participants who have different occupations, genders, cycling expertise from beginners to experts, and age gaps from 17 to 62 years old, were interviewed to get in-depth knowledge of their experience as bike users.</p>
      <p>Research shows that their logic is different from the car logic that dominates the roads. Since the market lacks an app with bike-specific logics to suggest routes, there is a niche opportunity for one whose content is mostly created by users who highlight routes based on safety, efficiency, discovery, and fitness.</p>

    <h3><strong>Design: Concepts & Sketching</strong></h3>
    <div>
      <p>Using the double diamond methodology, key insights from the research were taken into account to suggest ten features for the app based mainly on the pleasure and pains points that bike users experience in Mexico City. Using the Value vs Complexity Quadrant methodology, four features were selected to develop a prototype. They bring high value to users since they have not been experienced altogether in other apps for cycling in the city. Also, in terms of engineering, they are a combination of low and high complexity:</p>
      <p><strong>1) Route user rating system</strong> > Bike users have a high consensus on pleasure and pain points on the roads that could translate in a common criteria to evaluate routes.<br>
        <strong>2) Search engine with preference filter</strong> > Bike users are mixed users (commute, leisure, exercise) that prioritise different things when choosing a route.<br>
        <strong>3) Record and create route on the go (GPS)</strong> > Bike users have bike-specific logics and follow paths that are not currently displayed in apps in the market.<br>
        <strong>4) Suggested routes by popularity and rating</strong> > Bike users would want to see routes specific to / frequently used by bikes (not to cars).</p>
