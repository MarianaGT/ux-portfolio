    <h3><strong>Develop: Prototyping</strong></h3>
    <div>
      <p>Three usability tests were conducted to the interactive Low-fidelity prototype to come up with the High-fidelity version. A user task flow was created to conduct the usability test and further improvements were made on each design iteration.</p>

    <h3><strong>Usability Tests</strong></h3>
    <p>Usability tests revealed that users were comfortable in known User Interface patterns. These patterns were provided by previous experiences of apps they had been using to find routes. On every design iteration with improvements, the participants also showed an acceptance of the features and perceived them as gain points if the app was to be launched.</p>

    <h3><strong>Design: Iteration</strong></h3>
    <div>
      <p>Extra improvements were made with two new usability studies taking into account Accessibility. A special annotated iteration was made focusing on a KPI and using the resulting data to formulate hypothesis on how to increase task success rate.</p>
      <p>Aside from the interactive prototype, the project was complemented with a Style guide and a Pattern Library, ready for engineer delivery.</p>

    <h3><strong>Solution & Impact Overview</strong></h3>
    <div>
      <p>The BCR application is centred in the logic behind route decision-making of bike users in Mexico City. Relevant user feedback was implemented throughout each step of the design process, from concept to prototype. Its four features, pleasant interface, and ease of use could make it a popular product choice in the digital market.</p>
